Windows 10 x86 (32-bit) CCI + installer shellcode

The executable built using the VS solution (cci.exe) is a Command & Control Interface.
The implementation is very basic, since this is a demonstrator / exercise.
Once executed, cci.exe runs in the background and connects to the configured server, providing a command prompt.

The shellcode is aimed at listening for- and then receiving the data of cci.exe.
The shellcode saves cci.exe in C:\Users\admin\Desktop (modify it to fit your needs), then creates a registry value in HKCU Run.
This way, cci.exe is started at every boot of the target machine.

Content:
- cci:	Visual Studio 2022 C/C++ solution for the CCI (Command & Control Interface).
- shellcode_cci_receiver.py: a shellcode for Windows 10 x86 to receive and install cci.exe.
- send_file_data.py: a python utility to easily send the data of cci.exe to the listening shellcode.

How to use it:
1. In the cci solution, configure the attacker's host and port. The CCI will connect there.
2. Compile the cci solution using the x86 Release build configuration.
3. Modify the shellcode according to you needs (exe file name, user / path, etc.)
4. On the target machine, start the shellcode using python3 (use the 32-bit version!), and attach WinDbg to python.exe if you want to debug the shellcode.
5. On the attacker machine, listen for the CCI with "nc -l -p <port specified in configs.h>"
6. On the attacker machine, send cci.exe to the shellcode using send_file_data.py
7. The CCI should connect to the attacker, and the "cci> " prompt should be visible.
8. Verify that the HKCU Run key is present in the target machine's registry.
